# Writing an LLM-Inference-Mode Findings Paper

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## What Is This Paper Type?

An LLM-inference-mode findings paper investigates the behavior, capabilities, or limitations of LLMs through systematic experiments at inference time — without training new models. The contribution is typically empirical findings and analysis rather than a new method.

## Key Structural Elements

- **Multiple analysis sections.** These papers often have several result/analysis sections, each addressing a different research question or experimental angle.
- **RQ-driven structure.** Organize findings around clear Research Questions (see `03_paper_sections/results_and_analysis.md` for RQ structures).
- **Bold findings at paragraph starts.** Summarize key takeaways prominently so fast readers can extract the main messages.
- **Prepare the reader.** Since multiple analysis sections can feel unfamiliar, use the abstract and a dedicated overview section to motivate and preview the structure (see `03_paper_sections/results_and_analysis.md` for guidance on multiple result sections).
