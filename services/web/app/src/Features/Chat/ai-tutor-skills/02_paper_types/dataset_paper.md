# Writing a Dataset Paper

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Reviewer Criteria

For dataset papers, reviewers judge from the following criteria:
1. What is interesting about the problem so that you create a dataset?
2. What are the linguistic challenges of the data?
3. What are the crowdsourcing challenges when you collect data?
4. Use lots of examples to convince the reviewers.
5. What kinds of language/groups are represented by the data?
6. Write crowdsourcing instructions super clearly.

## Visualization

See `04_figures_and_tables/data_visualization.md` for required visual elements (table of examples, statistics tables, data construction figure).

## Writing About Data Collection

When describing data collection, cover:
- **Source and scope:** Where the data comes from, what time period and languages/groups it covers.
- **Collection process:** How data was gathered — scraping, crowdsourcing, manual annotation, etc.
- **Crowdsourcing details:** If using crowdsourcing, describe the annotation interface, instructions, qualification requirements, and compensation.
- **Inter-annotator agreement:** Report agreement metrics and describe how disagreements were resolved.
- **Quality assurance:** Describe any quality checks, filtering steps, or validation procedures.

## Comparing Your Dataset to Others

- **A comparison figure:** Visual comparison of key characteristics.
- **Through statistics:** A table comparing datasets across multiple dimensions.
