# Writing a CSS Paper to Analyze a Social Phenomenon

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## What Is a CSS Paper?

A Computational Social Science (CSS) paper uses computational methods (typically NLP) to analyze social phenomena. Common research areas include:
- Political framing analysis (how issues are presented in news and social media)
- Harmful language detection (hate speech, dehumanization, dogwhistles)
- Computational sociolinguistics (language variation, change, and social meaning in online communities)
- Stance detection and agenda-setting in media

## Key Elements

- **Ground the work in social science theory.** CSS papers should be motivated by social science questions, not just technical novelty.
- **Frame the social phenomenon clearly.** The introduction should establish why the phenomenon matters and what social science questions are being addressed.
- **Connect computational findings to social implications.** Results should be interpreted in terms of what they reveal about the social phenomenon, not just model performance.

## Data Collection for CSS Papers

When collecting CSS data, describe:
- The source of the data (e.g., social media platform, news outlets, government records).
- The time period and geographic scope covered.
- Any filtering or sampling procedures applied.
- Ethical considerations around studying human-generated content.

## Publication Venues

CSS papers appear at NLP venues (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL) as well as interdisciplinary venues. Select the appropriate track (e.g., computational social science track at ACL).
