# ML Paper Writing Tutor — Skill Library

This skill library is given to an LLM agent that reviews Overleaf papers and leaves inline writing suggestions. Each file is tagged with its modality requirement:
- **[TEXT]** — can be applied by reading the LaTeX source only.
- **[MULTIMODAL]** — requires viewing compiled figures/tables/images.

## 01_setup/ — Agent Setup Actions

Actions the agent should take before giving writing suggestions (e.g., web search, fetching prototype papers).

| File | Modality | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `finding_prototype_papers.md` | TEXT | Web search for prototype papers from top venues (>=8 pages), literature review completeness check, filtering by credibility, useful tools (Allen AI, CatalyzeX, DBLP, ACL Anthology, Google Scholar PDF Reader) |
| `example_papers_guide.md` | TEXT+MULTIMODAL | Index of 34 downloaded example papers in `example_papers/`, organized by section/paper type, with what to study in each |
