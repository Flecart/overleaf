# Writing the Conclusion

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Structure

Each bullet corresponds to approximately one short paragraph:
- What problem did we solve and how?
- What are some interesting next steps in this line of work?

Think of future work as potential "academic offspring."

## Key Principles

- Keep the conclusion brief. Do not simply repeat the abstract or the introduction.
- Summarize the key findings and contributions concisely.
- Use bullet lists for future work directions. If you are conducting follow-up research, state so explicitly to mark your territory on that direction.

## Section Ordering

See `05_writing_style/latex_formatting.md` for the standard ordering of final sections (Conclusion → Acknowledgment → Limitations → Ethical Considerations → References → Appendix).
