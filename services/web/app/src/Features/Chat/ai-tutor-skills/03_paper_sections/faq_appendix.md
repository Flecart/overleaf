# Writing the FAQ Section in the Appendix

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Why Include a FAQ?

Including a "Frequently Asked Questions" (FAQ) section in the Appendix is a useful but underused technique. Benefits:

- **Appeases reviewers:** Anticipates and addresses likely reviewer concerns preemptively.
- **Serves detailed readers:** Provides a reference for common questions without cluttering the main text.
- **Positive reception:** Papers with FAQ sections consistently receive positive feedback for thoroughness.

## How to Write It

- Anticipate the questions a reviewer or reader is most likely to ask after reading the paper.
- Frame each entry as a clear question, followed by a concise answer.
- Address potential weaknesses, design choice justifications, and scope clarifications.
- Keep answers focused — the FAQ supplements the main text, not replaces it.
