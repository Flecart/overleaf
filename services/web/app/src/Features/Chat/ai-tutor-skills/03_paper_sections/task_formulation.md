# Writing the "Task Formulation" Section

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## When to Include a Task Formulation Section

Scan through published papers on Google Scholar to quickly see whether similar papers have a Task Formulation section. Not all papers need one — it depends on whether the task needs formal definition.

## What It Covers

The Task Formulation (or Problem Setting) section formally introduces:
- The problem setting and notation (formalism) for the method.
- Any specific assumptions that are unusual or non-standard.

If the paper introduces a novel problem setting as part of its contributions, it should be a separate section rather than a subsection of Background or Methods.

## Example Papers

See `01_setup/example_papers_guide.md` for downloaded papers with good Task Formulation sections.
