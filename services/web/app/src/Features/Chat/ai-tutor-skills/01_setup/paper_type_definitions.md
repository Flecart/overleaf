# Paper Type Definitions

Use these definitions to classify an academic paper into one of the following types based on its abstract, introduction, and section outline.

---

## dataset

**Dataset Paper.** The primary contribution is a new dataset or benchmark. The paper describes the motivation for the dataset, the collection/annotation process, dataset statistics, and baseline experiments. Reviewers judge the dataset's novelty, quality, and usefulness to the community.

Examples: new NLP benchmarks, annotated corpora, crowdsourced datasets, curated evaluation suites.

---

## method_improvement

**Method Improvement Paper.** The primary contribution is a new technique, algorithm, or modification that improves upon existing methods for a known task. The paper identifies limitations of current approaches, proposes a solution, and demonstrates empirical gains through experiments and ablation studies.

Examples: new training procedures, architectural modifications, optimization techniques, regularization methods, fine-tuning strategies.

---

## llm_engineering

**LLM Engineering Paper.** The primary contribution addresses a specific engineering limitation or bottleneck in large language model systems. The paper starts with a concrete, measurable problem (e.g., context length limits, inference speed, memory usage), proposes solutions often targeting multiple aspects, and demonstrates improvements on relevant benchmarks.

Examples: context window extension methods, efficient inference techniques, memory-efficient training, model compression, serving optimizations.

---

## llm_inference_findings

**LLM Inference Findings Paper.** The primary contribution is empirical findings about LLM behavior, capabilities, or limitations discovered through systematic experiments at inference time — without training new models. The paper is organized around multiple analysis sections, each addressing different research questions or experimental angles.

Examples: prompt sensitivity studies, in-context learning analysis, reasoning capability evaluations, bias and fairness audits of existing LLMs, benchmark evaluations.

## css

**Computational Social Science (CSS) Paper.** The primary contribution uses computational methods (typically NLP) to analyze social phenomena. The work is grounded in social science theory and connects computational findings to social implications. Common topics include political framing, harmful language, sociolinguistics, and stance detection.

Examples: media framing analysis, hate speech detection in social contexts, opinion dynamics studies, computational analysis of online communities.

---

## position

**Position Paper.** The primary contribution is a novel perspective, hypothesis, or framework rather than empirical results. The paper proposes a way of thinking about a problem, supported by case studies, thought experiments, or reinterpretation of existing findings. Two common structures: (1) model/hypothesis proposal with case studies, or (2) organized collection of arguments grouped thematically.

Examples: framework proposals, opinion pieces with formal structure, paradigm critiques, calls-to-action with supporting arguments.

---

## other

**Other.** The paper does not clearly fit any of the above categories. Use this when the paper combines multiple types equally or follows a structure not captured by the defined types.
