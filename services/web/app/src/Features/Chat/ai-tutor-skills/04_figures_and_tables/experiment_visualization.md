# Visualization for Experiments

[MULTIMODAL — requires viewing figures/plots]

## Plan Figures and Tables Before You Have Results

Many readers read papers as: Abstract → Figures → Conclusion. Plan the flow of figures early — from an introductory figure on page 1 to experimental figures and tables. Ideally, figures allow an educated skimmer to understand the key idea and key take-home, and be convinced that the assessments were rigorous.

Design empty tables early and fill them in as results come in. This forces you to think through the hypotheses you are testing and the message you are trying to convey, rather than ending up with data dumps to interpret post-hoc.

## One Key Message Per Figure

Each figure should communicate one key trend or result. Ask yourself: what is the key take-home? Write it down, then go back to the figure — does that trend "pop" visually, or is the eye distracted by other structure? If the trend does not pop, redesign the figure.

## Improving Tables and Figures

- What should be the order of each item?
- What should be highlighted? We can feel free to use bold/italics/color.
- Should we transform the statistics, e.g., raw number to percentage? Or removing one column or two columns?

## Data Ordering

- Arrange progressive or time-series data logically (e.g., education levels basic-to-advanced, dates chronologically).

## Chart Type Appropriateness

- Only use line charts when certain the horizontal axis represents continuous or ordinal data — do not use line charts for categorical data.
- Intentionally choose chart types matching the message (showing trends, correlations, changes, complexity, etc.).

## Numeric Precision

- Balance decimal places with readability. Round numbers consistently; avoid unnecessary digits that complicate interpretation.

## Visual Clutter

- Use smoothing sparingly — it can mislead about data resolution. Always show data points underlying trendlines so readers can assess evidence quality.

## Visualization Tools

- **D3.js** (d3js.org): A JavaScript library for creating custom dynamic data visualizations with full control over scales, shapes, layouts, geographic projections, and animations. Useful for interactive exploratory tools and publication-quality figures.
- **Merlin Bird ID** (merlin.allaboutbirds.org): An example of turning research into a beautiful, user-facing demo application — relevant inspiration for papers that include interactive demos.
