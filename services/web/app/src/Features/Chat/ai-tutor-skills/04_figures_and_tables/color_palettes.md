# Color Palettes for Paper Figures

[MULTIMODAL — requires viewing figure colors]

## Palette Recommendations

- You can use palettes similar to Nature papers' figures for a professional and visually appealing look.
- Use curated palette tools: ColorBrewer for scales and categories, Tachyons for basic colors, uiGradients for gradient work.

## Accessibility

- **Colorblind-friendly:** Use color schemes that are accessible to readers with color vision deficiency. Test with colorblind simulators.
- **Contrast:** Ensure sufficient contrast between text and backgrounds. Switch text from black to white on dark backgrounds. Use contrast-checking tools (e.g., WebAIM).
- **Black-and-white fallback:** Figures should remain interpretable when printed in grayscale.

## Color Usage Principles

- Use color to convey meaning and enable semantic grouping, not just for decoration.
- Restrict color palette — use as few colors as feasible.
- Eliminate unnecessary 3D effects and color gradients unless essential. Remove "chartjunk" (distracting decorative elements).
