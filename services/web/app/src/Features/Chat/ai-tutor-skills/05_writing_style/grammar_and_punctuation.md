# Grammar and Punctuation

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Importance

Formatting and grammar is a signal showing professionalism, and could bias the reviewers.

## Punctuation Rules

### Spacing
- **Space before "(":** Example: "We tested (with this procedure) on our data." "This has been proven in previous studies (Chen et al., 2019)."
- **No space before "%":** Example: "99%"
- **Footnote placement:** Footnote should go after the punctuation, without space. Example: "We use the nltk package,\footnote{...} and conduct the following analyses."

### American English Punctuation
- For American English, the comma "," and period "." should go inside the quotation marks. Example: We call him "a great man."

### Semicolons and Colons
- Use ";" and ":" correctly. Pay attention to verb tenses throughout the paper.

### Comma Rules
- Do not use a comma between two verb phrases (without subjects) joined by a conjunction.
- Do use a comma between two independent clauses (with subjects and verbs) joined by a conjunction.

## Tense

- General conclusions and findings of the paper should be written in present tense, because they remain true at the time the paper is read.
- Be consistent with tense. Avoid switching at all costs.
- Avoid future tense when possible. Instead of "In Section 3 we will show...", write "In Section 3 we show...".

## Pronoun Clarity

Avoid nonreferential uses of "this," "that," "these," and "it." Always use explicit identification.

- **Bad:** "This is important because..."
- **Good:** "This finding is important because..."

## "That" vs. "Which"

- **"That"** is defining (restrictive): "The method that uses attention performs best."
- **"Which"** is nondefining (nonrestrictive): "The method, which uses attention, performs best."

## Vague Language

- Never say "for various reasons" — explain the actual reasons.
- **"etc."** is only acceptable when the remaining items are completely obvious to the reader.
- Avoid "and so on" and "and so forth."

## Active vs. Passive Voice

- Avoid overusing passive voice — it is clunky and obscures who did what.
- Prefer active voice: "We propose X" instead of "X is proposed."

## Filler Words and Conciseness

- Avoid filler words: "can," "In order to," "shall," and others. Think about what you are trying to say, then say it — nothing else.
  - Bad: "The bank loan problem can be reformulated as a special subset of the contextual bandit problem."
  - Good: "The bank loan problem is a special instance of a contextual bandit problem."
- Once you have written the initial text, try to delete around one-third of the words. That is typically how much "fluff" there is.
- If a sentence gets too long and cumbersome, divide it into two.
- Avoid word repetition within a paragraph or sentence ("...that features that are...").

## Bold and Italic Usage

- Decide what **bold** and *italic* mean and be consistent. A common convention: **bold for highlighting the key message in a paragraph**, *italic for key words* in a sentence.
- Do not overuse bold and italic — if everything is highlighted, nothing stands out.

## Plagiarism

- Never copy-paste from other papers unless you are verbatim quoting something (with quotation marks and citation). It is easier and more ethical to write from scratch than to try to modify copied text until it looks different.

## Formality

- Eliminate contractions ("don't" → "do not").
- Do not substitute "&" or "/" for words except in names or space-restricted contexts.
- Avoid informal figures of speech and metaphorical language in technical writing.
- Use simple language. Avoid rare words or sounding "fancy" — for many scientists English is not the first language.
- Avoid anthropomorphisms ("knowledge," etc.) when describing AI algorithms.
- "On the other hand" should not come without "On the one hand."

## Numbers in Text

- Spell out small whole numbers (a reasonable threshold is numbers up to ten or twenty). Use numerals for larger numbers and in equations.
- Never start a sentence with a numeral — spell it out or restructure.

## Grammar Tools

- Always run Grammarly over the Overleaf document to catch simple grammatical errors.
- There is an Overleaf plugin called "WriteFull" that corrects grammar.

## British vs. American English

Choose either British English or American English, and use that consistently throughout the paper:
- **Spellings:** e.g., "humour" vs "humor," "recognise" vs "recognize", "acknowledgement" vs. "acknowledgment"
- **Punctuations:** single quote ' vs. double quote "
- **Tip:** On Overleaf, switch "spell check" from "English" to "English (American)" or "English (British)" to make the distinction easier.
