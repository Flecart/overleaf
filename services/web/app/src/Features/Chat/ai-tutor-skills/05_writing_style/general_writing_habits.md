# General Writing Habits

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Writing Is Inseparable from Thinking

Science writing cannot be separated from science doing. Writing a paper is a form of teaching — explaining something to others reveals gaps in your understanding that you did not know you had. By trying to write your story, you find the holes in your story. If you do this early, you have time to go back and let this drive your science.

## Write Early and Iteratively

- Begin writing before all experiments are complete. A well-written paper with incomplete experiments is more useful than a sloppy draft with complete ones.
- Writing clarifies what work actually needs doing — the introduction reveals necessary experiments, the literature review shapes experimental design.
- Start with an outline: download the conference template, create a strong title and abstract, then write section headers. This file will turn into the final document.
- You can write the introduction long before the science is done — this helps structure your thinking. You will rewrite it once you know the outcome, but the early version structures the whole project.
- Write a "shitty first draft" — focus on structure, logic, and story first. Sketch figures and plots on a whiteboard, photograph them, and put them in the paper. Build the whole structure before the work is done.
- Aim for a complete draft at least a week before the deadline.

## Start with an Outline

- Each line in the outline captures one idea and will correspond to one paragraph in the final version. It is much easier to change the outline of a building before building it.
- Keep the summary line as LaTeX comments ahead of every paragraph:
```latex
%TL;DR of paragraph
Lorem ipsum... (expansion of the TL;DR)
```
This keeps you on track and makes it easy for anyone providing feedback to quickly see the overall flow.

## One Key Idea Per Paper

The paper should convey one central message. If you have multiple distinct ideas, write separate papers rather than combining them. Distill the core contribution into an "elevator pitch" — a single sentence that captures what is new. This requires truly understanding the core of your contribution.

## First Sentences Tell the Whole Story

A paragraph represents a single statement or claim. The first sentence should introduce the claim, and the body of the paragraph should present supporting evidence or arguments. A quick check: read just the first sentences of every paragraph — they should tell the whole story of the paper.

## Every Section Tells a Story

Every section of the paper should tell a story with linear progression and no significant interruptions. Each sentence's placement should have clear reasoning discoverable without reading ahead.

## Clarity on Contributions

Be extremely clear on contributions. Never blur the lines between what had been done before and what you did. The reader should always know whose work is being described.

## Consistency in Presentation

- Be consistent in presentation form across the paper. If one subsection uses bullet point lists, parallel subsections should use a similar format.
- Be consistent with terminology. If something is called "refBLEU" in one place, use the same term everywhere. Avoid synonyms for work-specific terminology at all costs.
- Maintain uniform capitalization, punctuation, grammar, and formatting throughout.
- Introduce terminology that is specific to this work. If it risks being confusing, mention it right next to it: "This should not be confused with..."

## Scientific Claims

- Be precise and evidence-based:
  - "200 references and 2 annotators" is not sufficient unless proved by a systematic study.
  - Use hedging language when appropriate: "most standard way" should be "one of the most common ways."
- Remove qualifying hedge words like "rather," "somewhat," and "arguably" — express claims more directly instead.
- Do not describe research as "interesting," "fascinating," or "groundbreaking." Avoid "It is important..." statements without supporting arguments. Explain noteworthy results by specifying achievements directly.
- Minimize "in recent years," "has become popular," "nowadays." When necessary, cite evidence.
- Avoid subjective claims — adjectives are usually red flags. Cite any claim that is not supported by the paper's own experiments.
- Avoid grandiose language or overly broad claims — it makes it easy for reviewers to attack the paper for no good reason.

## Headings for Readability

- Have one heading every ~10 or 15 lines, to keep the reader attentive.
- Fast readers (spending 10 sec per page) should still get good takeaways.
- Use bold phrases at the start of paragraphs when there are multiple paragraphs in a subsection.

## Put Readers First

- Convey the intuition first — once the reader has the intuition, they can follow the details, but not vice versa.
- Use concrete examples to introduce ideas before diving into formalism.
- Test narrative flow by speaking text aloud to detect incoherence.

## Listen to Your Readers

- Treat every review like gold dust. Be genuinely grateful for criticism as well as praise.
- Read every criticism as a positive suggestion for something you could explain more clearly.
- Fix the paper so that the intended meaning is apparent even to the most casual reader.

## Fresh Perspective

Step away from manuscripts and return later to reset your short-term memory and identify problems that felt natural when freshly written.

## Writing Is Logical Thinking

Writing is laying out your logical thoughts.
