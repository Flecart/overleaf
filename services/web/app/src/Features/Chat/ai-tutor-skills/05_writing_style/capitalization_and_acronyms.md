# Capitalization and Acronyms

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Capitalization of ML Terms

Normal machine learning terms should be lower cased:
- "machine learning (ML)"
- "information extraction (IE)"
- "partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP)"

Avoid random capitalization, even for method names and when introducing acronyms. Only proper nouns are capitalized (e.g., "Markov chain Monte Carlo," "Transformer").

## Introducing Abbreviations

Always:
1. Mention the full term before the abbreviation.
2. Once the abbreviation is introduced, consistently use it everywhere.
3. Only introduce abbreviations and symbols that you actually use in the paper.

Example: "We use large language models (LLMs) for this task. LLMs have shown..."

If a term risks being confusing, mention it right next to the introduction: "This should not be confused with..."

## Title Capitalization

For all section and subsection titles, use a consistent capitalization strategy:
- **Title capitalization:** Capitalize major words. Example: "Writing the Related Work Section"
- **Sentence capitalization:** Only capitalize the first word and proper nouns. Example: "Writing the related work section"

Use online APA style capitalizer tools for uncertain words.

## Consistency

Whatever strategy is chosen, use it consistently throughout:
- Paper title
- Section titles
- Subsection titles
- `\paragraph{}` headings
